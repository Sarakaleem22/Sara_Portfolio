# Machine Learning 

## [Project 1: Rainfall prediction](https://github.com/Sarakaleem22/Rainfall_Prediction)
### Project Overview
* Obtained the dataset using Kaggle and implemented three rainfall prediction models, namely; Support Vector Regression, Random Forest regressor and Decision Tree Regressor.
* Performed the pre-processing, feature engineering, EDA and implemented machine learning models using R Script.
* Hypertuned the models for better accuracy.
* All the three models with the least RMSE among all the experiments are as follows:
* Decision Tree Regressor (70:30 split): 0.2859088
* Random Forest Regressor (ntree=500): 0.1569539
* Support Vector Regressor (Feature scaled data): 0.361147

## [Project 2: USA-Housing Price Prediction](https://github.com/Sarakaleem22/USA_Housing-Linear_Regression)
### Project Overview
* Implemented Linear Regression model too predict the price of the houses in USA.
* Checked missing values and also checked the correlation between the variables in the dataset.
* Split the dataset into training - testing as 0.8:0.2
* Used R^2 as the performance measure of the model and got the score as 92.69%
* Predicted the price of the house based on user input.

# Natural Language Processing

## [Project 1: SPAM SMS Classifier](https://github.com/Sarakaleem22/SMS_OR_HAM/blob/main/README.md)
### Project Overview
* Used a SMS Collection dataset stored in text format to classify the SMS as SPAM or HAM.
* Used the concepts of Natural Language Processing for text pre-processing (removing stopwords, punctuations,etc.)
* Implemented Naive Bayes Classification Model.
* The accuracy of the model was high (97.91%), which means the model performed really well.
* Classified the SMS as SPAM or HAM based on user input.


# Exploratory Data Analysis

## [Project 1: Data Exploration on Iris Data](https://github.com/Sarakaleem22/Iris_Data)
### Project Overview
* Performed Exploratory data analysis on Iris Dataset using python.
* Several python libraries were used and the features and label columns were selected.
* The visualization shows various plots such as Pie Chart, Historgram and Scatterplots.
