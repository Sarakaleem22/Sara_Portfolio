## [Project 1: Rainfall prediction](https://github.com/Sarakaleem22/Rainfall_Prediction)
### Project Overview
* Obtained the dataset using Kaggle and implemented three rainfall prediction models, namely; Support Vector Regression, Random Forest regressor and Decision Tree Regressor.
* Performed the pre-processing, feature engineering, EDA and implemented machine learning models using R Script.
* Hypertuned the models for better accuracy.
* All the three models with the least RMSE among all the experiments are as follows:
* Decision Tree Regressor (70:30 split): 0.2859088
* Random Forest Regressor (ntree=500): 0.1569539
* Support Vector Regressor (Feature scaled data): 0.361147


# Exploratory Data Analysis

## [Project 1: Data Exploration on Iris Data](https://github.com/Sarakaleem22/Iris_Data)
### Project Overview
* Performed Exploratory data analysis on Iris Dataset using python.
* Several python libraries were used and the features and label columns were selected.
* The visualization shows various plots such as Pie Chart, Historgram and Scatterplots.
