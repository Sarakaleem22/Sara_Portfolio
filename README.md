# Project 1: Rainfall prediction
# Project Overview
* Obtained the dataset using Kaggle and implemented three rainfall prediction models, namely; Support Vector Regression, Random Forest regressor and Decision Tree Regressor.
* Performed the pre-processing, feature engineering, EDA and implemented machine learning models using R Script.
* Hypertuned the models for better accuracy.
* All the three models with the least RMSE among all the experiments are as follows:
* Decision Tree Regressor (70:30 split): 0.2859088
* Random Forest Regressor (ntree=500): 0.1569539
* Support Vector Regressor (Feature scaled data): 0.361147
